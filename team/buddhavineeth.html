<div class="paragraph">
<p>Calgo is an all-in-one personal meal tracking assistant which seeks to encourage a healthy lifestyle among its users. It allows users to not only have a convenient nutritional record of all their favourite food entries, but also track, monitor, and plan their food consumption. Moreover, the team has come up with a plethora of user-centric features to make Calgo well-suited to provide users with both convenience and utility.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My team was tasked with morphing an existing <a href="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1920S1/addressbook-level3">Address Book Level 3 (AB3) project</a> into a new product via Brownfield software development.
We were therefore required to use the existing AB3 project as Calgo&#8217;s project foundation, to create a desktop application supporting the Command Line Interface. This was to target users who prefer typing but also enjoy the benefits of a Graphical User Interface.
With all of us being food lovers and realising a greater societal need for healthy eating, Calgo was born.</p>

<h2 id="summary-of-contributions"><a class="link" href="#summary-of-contributions">Summary of contributions</a></h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Major enhancement</strong>: I implemented the <strong>generation of useful statistics and key insights</strong> via the <code>report</code> command.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>What it does: The feature provides the user with a statistical summary of the food he/she has consumed on a given day. It also generates personalised insights on how the user
can improve his/her eating habits and whether his/her favourite food item should continue to be part of the diet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Justification: The feature improves Calgo significantly because a user can now go beyond just tracking his/her daily meal consumption. The user can now obtain insights on
how to improve their eating habits and find out the food that contributes the most to their daily calorie count. They also no longer have to spend lots of time calculating the nutritional content they consumed in a day because
the statistics section does that for them instantly. This makes Calgo much more than a meal tracker. It helps the user build a healthy lifestyle through eating.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Highlights: This enhancement requires an in-depth understanding of the Logic and Model components' architecture and a good understanding of String formatting. It also makes use of a sophisticated sorting mechanism
to decide what the favourite food of the user is in the past week.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Major enhancement</strong>: I also implemented the <code>goal</code> command.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>What it does: The feature helps the user to set a daily calorie goal. This goal is also reflected in Calgo&#8217;s GUI, so that the user is always reminded of how many calories he/she is left with whenever they consume food.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Justification: Our target user is health-conscious and wants to build a healthy lifestyle. As that is a vague goal, it often is hard to achieve. That is why the <code>goal</code> command
is created, to help the user set clear objectives for each day and chunk their big long-term goal of eating healthily into smaller daily goals. This allows them to see noticeable progress too and is motivating. The goal is also
used to generate personalised insights in the abovementioned <code>report</code> command.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Highlights: For this enhancement, I worked on the front-end, back-end logic, storage of the goal and unit testing as well. This required a deep understanding of all aspects of the project.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Minor enhancement</strong>: I helped in the redesigning of the GUI by adding the Goal Displays, Remaining Calorie Count Display, creating labels and helping Janice with
the graph feature.</p>

Calgo does this by using a mix of your ratings and quantity consumed of each <code>Food</code> to intelligently infer what your favourite <code>Food</code> is. It then analyses if you can continue to keep your favourite <code>Food</code> in the past week in your diet based on your daily calorie goal.
Over time, through Calgo&#8217;s smart suggestions, you will eventually have a diet consisting of your favourite <code>Food</code> entries that are compatible with your goal. How awesome is that!</p>

<p>This feature allows a user to automatically generate a report that contains statistics and personalised insights based on
his or her food consumption pattern on a given date. Do note that the generated report is a .txt file.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The user can invoke this functionality by entering the <code>report</code> command, which follows the following format: <code>report d/DATE</code>.<br></p>

<p>From the above diagram, creating a report for the consumption patterns on 27th of March 2020 involves the following steps:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 1: User inputs <code>report d/2020-03-27</code> to generate the insights report based on food consumption of the abovementioned date.<br></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 2: This input is saved as a <code>String</code> and passed into the <code>LogicManager</code>.<br></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 3: The <code>String</code> input is parsed by <code>CalgoParser</code>, which removes the "d/" <code>Prefix</code> and sends
the date input to <code>ReportCommandParser</code>.<br></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 4: Once the <code>ReportCommandParser</code> checks that the given date is valid, it creates a <code>ReportCommand</code> object and
returns it to <code>LogicManager</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 5: <code>LogicManager</code> then executes the <code>ReportCommand</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 6: From <code>Model</code>, <code>ReportCommand</code> retrieves the required objects to construct an instance of <code>ReportGenerator</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 7: With the relevant objects retrieved from Steps 6, <code>ReportCommand</code> constructs a
<code>ReportGenerator</code> object.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 8: Using the <code>ReportGenerator</code> object, <code>ReportCommand</code> invokes the <strong>crucial</strong> method <code>generateInsights()</code>, which prints
neatly organised sections of analysed data based on the <code>DailyFoodLog</code> of the input date. For the section that gives insights related to
the user&#8217;s favourite <code>Food</code>, the past seven days of <code>DailyFoodLog</code> objects are analysed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 9: This newly generated report is saved in the <code>data/reports</code> folder. If the report is successfully generated,
the <code>CommandResult</code> is true. Otherwise, it is false. This <code>CommandResult</code> object is finally returned to <code>LogicManager</code>,
to signify the end of the command and GUI shows a result message to the user.</p>

<p>Pros: This implementation is more efficient as it does not have to churn out all existing consumption data produced by the user so far.</p>

<p>(by Vineeth)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This feature helps a user chunk his or her long term goal of developing a healthy lifestyle into smaller daily goals.
Psychologically, this helps to motivate them as the perceived difficulty of achieving the long term goal reduces.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The user can set a daily calorie goal with the <code>goal</code> command, which follows the following format: <code>goal GOAL</code>.</p>

<h4 id="implementation-2"><a class="link" href="#implementation-2">Implementation</a></h4>

<p>In addition to the <code>GoalCommandParser</code>, the <code>goal</code> command relies heavily on the <code>DailyGoal</code> class, which is part of the

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To address the issue where a user does not want to set up a daily calorie goal, Calgo places a <code>DUMMY_VALUE</code> of 0 calories,
as shown in the code snippet below, from <code>DailyGoal</code> class. To cater to a wide range of users, it also has a broad range of acceptable
values, ranging from 1 to 99999. However, to guide users towards a healthy lifestyle, the App does display a warning
message whenever a user sets a goal below the <code>MINIMUM_HEALTHY_CALORIES</code>.</p>

<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>    // Values used for GoalCommandParser when parsing user inputted goals.
