== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in
the link:{repoURL}/tree/master/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the Calgo Application. From now on, all
instances of Calgo Application will be referred to as App.
Given below is a quick overview of each component.

The `Main` component comprises of two classes called link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/life/calgo/Main.java[`Main`] and
link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/life/calgo/MainApp.java[`MainApp`].
This component is responsible for:

* Launching App: Initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* Exiting App: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
In particular, the `LogsCenter` class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Writes log messages to the App's log file, for various classes.

The rest of the App comprises of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The User Interface (UI).
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: The in-memory representation of the App data.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: The file manager for reading from and writing to the hard disk.

Each of the four components:

* Defines its _Application Programming Interface (API)_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete n/Apple`.

.Component interactions for `delete n/Apple` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/tree/master/src/main/java/life/calgo/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `FoodListPanel`, `DailyListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/life/calgo/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component:

. Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
. Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/life/calgo/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `FoodRecordParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a food).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete n/Apple")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete n/Apple` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/life/calgo/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

. `Model` stores user's preferences in a `UserPref` object.
. `Model` also stores Food Record data.
. This component exposes both `ObservableList<Food>` and `ObservableList<ConsumedFood>`. The data stored in
these two list objects is reflected in UI. Therefore, any changes made to the data in these lists are shown in the UI in
real-time.
. This component does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
To make `Model` follow the Object Oriented Programming (OOP) Paradigm more closely,
we can store a `Tag` list in `Food Record`, which `Food` objects can reference.
This would allow `Food Record` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`,
instead of each `Food` needing their own `Tag` object.
An example of how such a model may look like is given in the below diagram. +
 +

.Structure of the Model Component
image::BetterModelClassDiagram.png[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/life/calgo/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component can do the following:

. Saves `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back for the next session.
. Saves `FoodRecord` data in json format and read it back for the next session.
. Generates an insights report based on user food consumption.
. Generates a user-friendly version of the current `FoodRecord`.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `life.calgo.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::lexicographicallistcommand[]
=== Lexicographically-Ordered `list`
==== Implementation
With a large number of `Food` objects in the App, it will be useful to see all entries sorted in lexicographic order. +

The `list` command is able to show all current `Food` entries in the `Model`.
Therefore, it is one of the most commonly used commands in `Calgo`, especially after a `find` command.
It may seem that the `list` command is responsible for keeping the `Food` entries sorted, however, that is not the case.

Sorting `Food` objects by lexicographic order is done by the `UniqueFoodList`.
`Food` objects are able to be sorted because the `Food` class implements the `Comparable<Food>` interface. +

How the `UniqueFoodList` works:

* Existing `Food` objects in the list are arranged in lexicographic order by `Name`.
* `UniqueFoodList` sorts the `Food` whenever they are added or edited in the `Model`.

With this, a top-level idea of the execution of the lexicographical `list` command is given in the sequence diagram below:

image::ListCommandSequenceDiagram.png[]

Step 1: `UI` detects that the user has entered a `String`. +
Step 2: `UI` passes this `String` into `Logic` to eventually produce a `ListCommand`. +
Step 3: `Logic` executes the `ListCommand` to filter out relevant `Food` entries from the `Model`. +
Step 4: All `Food` entries are shown in the GUI. +
Step 5: `Logic` produces a `CommandResult` which displays its status in the GUI.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How List executes sorting operation

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Sort whenever `Food` is added or edited in the `Model`.
** Pros: Will guarantee correctness of sorting. Furthermore, since `Food` objects are sorted whenever they are added or edited one by one, each sorting operation will not be too expensive.
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementations of each individual underlying command are correct and do not interfere with the sorting process. Moreover, this may be expensive if there are many unsorted `Food` objects at once, which is seldom the case.
* **Alternative 2:** Sort only when calling the `list` command.
** Pros: Easier to implement, may be less computationally expensive.
** Cons: May lead to certain bugs, especially during adding or editing such as through the `update` command. Also, not guaranteed to work when reading in from `foodrecord.json` for the next session.

===== Aspect: Data structure to store `Food` objects

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use `UniqueFoodList` to store all `Food` objects.
** Pros: Any changes to the `Model` are automatically reflected in the GUI. This is very useful for testing and debugging manually. Also, we do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Many of the underlying `ObservableList` methods are built-in and cannot be edited. They are also difficult to understand for those unfamiliar. This can make development slightly trickier, especially in following certain software engineering principles.
* **Alternative 2:** Use a simpler data structure like an `ArrayList`.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: More troublesome as we to implement methods to display on the GUI. Also, the methods create a risk to violations of certain software engineering principles, if not careful. These methods are also subject to being changed which can introduce regression in the future.

==== Summary

`list` will make the GUI display a lexicographically sorted list of `Food` previously entered. This can be exemplified in an activity diagram below:

.Activity Diagram for List command
image::ListActivityDiagram.png[]
// end::lexicographiclistcommand[]

=== Food Consumption Management
In Calgo, you will find that there is a date associated with each list of `ConsumedFood`.
When adding food to be consumed, removing food, or displaying food consumed on certain days,
a `FilteredList` will be populated with relevant `ConsumedFood`.

==== Implementation
The `nom`, `vomit` and `stomach` commands are facilitated by the `FoodRecord`.  +
`FoodRecord` contains a `UniqueDateToLogMap`, which maps a `LocalDate` to a `DailyFoodLog`. +
`DailyFoodLog` contains a `LinkedHashMap` storing `Food` in the sequence that they were consumed and maps those `Food` to a `Double` portion.

This section covers how the `nom` command is implemented. The `vomit` and `stomach` commands work in very similar way, hence their implementation is omitted for brevity.


A top-level illustration of the execution of a `nom` command is given in the sequence diagram below:

image:NomSequenceDiagram.png[]

Step 1: User enters a command, which is saved as a `String` and passed into the `LogicManager`. +
Step 2: The `String` cascades down the layers of abstraction until `NomCommandParser` handles it and creates a
`DailyFoodLog` which reflects the consumption. +
Step 3: A `NomCommand` is created and executed, updating both `ModelManager` and `FoodRecord` about the consumed food. +
Step 4: A `FilteredList` in `ModelManger` will then check with `FoodRecord` to create `ConsumedFood` items to display in the Graphical User Interface (GUI). +
Step 5: The GUI automatically detects changes in `FilteredList` and refreshes to display updated content.


==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How `nom` executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create a new `DailyFoodLog` to pass into `ModelManager` and `FoodRecord`.
** Pros: Maintain comprehensive layers of abstraction and allows code to be easily testable.
** Cons: Difficult for newcomers or even existing users to trace because of long execution path.

* **Alternative 2:** Bypass `ModelManager` or even not use `FoodRecord` for storage of data during runtime by allowing everything to be done
from parser.
** Pros: Reduce dependencies on `ModelManager` and `FoodRecord`, and make code contained in a single class file easier to navigate.
** Cons: Violates layers of abstraction set in place by previous structure of AddressBook3. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and reduce
cohesiveness of code.

==== Summary

The `nom` command adds a `Food` item consumed by the user into the `stomach`. The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when the user executes a `nom` command.

.Activity Diagram for Nom
image::NomActivityDiagram.png[]

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the consumption commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a single `FilteredList` to store food for any day by repopulating it each time
a consumption related command is used.
** Pros: Only uses a single `FilteredList`, so it is clear which list you are using for display.
** Cons: May have performance issue in terms of speed when there are too many entries.

* **Alternative 2:** Use a `FilteredList` for each date, to store food consumed on that date.
** Pros: Faster retrieval for display of `ConsumedFood` items. However, under practical circumstances, the difference is negligible.
** Cons: May have performance issue in terms of storage because it requires many lists to be stored in addition to `LinkedHashMap`
in `DailyFoodLog` for each `LocalDate`.

=== Updating `FoodRecord`
This feature allows you to add a food preset with all its nutritional details into the `FoodRecord`.
This makes it convenient for you to keep track of your `Food` consumed in the day without having to manually key in the nutritional details every time you do so.

==== Implementation
The update mechanism is facilitated by `FoodRecord` and `UpdateCommand`. An additional operation was implemented into `FoodRecord`:

* `FoodRecord#hasExistingFood()` - Checks if there is an existing `Food` in `FoodRecord` based on its name only

This operation was exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#hasExistingFood()`.

The update feature first checks if there is already an existing `Food` item with the same name
inside `FoodRecord` using the method `FoodRecord#hasExistingFood()`.

If there is already an existing `Food` with the same name, the existing `Food` item will override the `Food` item inside `FoodRecord` with
the new nutritional information provided by the user. +
Otherwise, the new `Food` item will be added into the `FoodRecord`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the update operation works in both cases:

.Sequence Diagram for Update command
image::UpdateSequenceDiagram.png[]
NOTE: The lifeline for `UpdateCommandParser` and `UpdateCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Updating the `FoodRecord` when there is an existing `Food` item in `FoodRecord`

* *Alternative 1 (current choice):* Overrides the existing `Food` item with the new `Food` item
** Pros: No need for a separate command of `edit` to deal with existing `Food` item apart from `add` to add new `Food` item into the `FoodRecord`.
Instead, a smarter command of `update` is used to deal with both scenarios.
** Cons:
This might not be intuitive for the user since the word "update" is generally assumed to be for editing something only, and not necessarily adding something.

* *Alternative 2:* Informs the user that there is already an existing `Food` item, and direct him to use another function `edit` to edit the existing `Food` instead.
** Pros: In the event where the user is unaware that there is already an existing `Food` item, this two step process will be clearer to him that he is
in fact editing a `Food` item and not adding a new one in.
** Cons: This is more tedious for the user since more steps is required to change an existing `Food` item. On top of that, an additional command of `edit` will be required and `update`
should be replaced with `add` for clearer user experience.

==== Summary
The `update` command is a smart command that either updates an existing `Food` item in the `FoodRecord` with new nutritional information,
or updates a new `Food` item into the `FoodRecord`
The following activity diagram summarises what happens when a user enters a valid `update` command:

.Activity Diagram for Update command
image::UpdateActivityDiagram.png[]

//tag:: Report[]
=== Generate Insights Report
This feature allows a user to generate a report that contains statistics and deliverable insights based on
personal food consumption patterns.

The functionality can be invoked by entering the `report d/DATE` command.
This command generates a report that is based on the food consumed by
the user on the specified date.

==== Implementation
The specified feature is facilitated by `ReportGenerator` class in the `Storage` component.
In this section, the implementation features of the `ReportGenerator` class will be further explained.

`ReportGenerator` class implements the following operation:

* `ReportGenerator#generateReport()` - Creates report containing an analysis of all food consumed by user on the
given date when inputting the `report` command.

Whenever the `report d/DATE` command is given by the user, the `ReportGenerate#generateReport()` operation is called.

The following sequence diagram illustrates the top-level execution of the `generateReport()` operation:

image::ReportFeatureSequenceDiagram.png[]

Step 1: User inputs `report d/2020-03-27` to generate the insights report based on food consumption of 27 March 2020. +

Step 2: This input is saved as a `String` and passed into the `LogicManager`. +

Step 3: The `String` input is parsed by `FoodRecordParser`, which removes the "d/" prefix tag and sends
the date input to `ReportCommandParser`. +

Step 4: Once the `ReportCommandParser` checks that the given date is valid, it creates a `ReportCommand` object and
returns it to `LogicManager`.

Step 5: `LogicManager` then executes the `ReportCommand`.

Step 6: From `Model`, `ReportCommand` retrieves the `DailyFoodLog` object that stores all `Food` consumed on the input date.

Step 7: From `Model`, `ReportCommand` also retrieves `DailyGoal` object, which stores the daily number of calories the user wants to consume.

Step 8: With the relevant objects retrieved from Steps 6 and 7, `ReportCommand` constructs a
`ReportGenerator` object.

Step 9: Using the `ReportGenerator` object, `ReportCommand` calls `#generateInsights()`, which prints metainformation
, food-wise statistics, aggregate statistics and insights based on the `DailyFoodLog` of the input date.

Step 10: This newly generated report is saved in the `/reports` folder. If the report is successfully generated,
the `CommandResult` is true. Otherwise, it is false. This `CommandResult` object is finally returned to `LogicManager`,
to signify the end of the command.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How generate report executes

* *Alternative 1 (current choice):* Print insights into a .txt file.

** Pros: The implementation allows users to easily edit the contents of the report should they have realised they
did not log in certain food items on that day.
** Cons: Users could cheat by modifying values in the report. This defeats the purpose of the report to improve their
self-awareness of their food consumption patterns.

* *Alternative 2:* Print insights into a pdf file.
** Pros: The insights appear more legitimate and neatly formatted.

** Cons: Requires use of external libraries, which occupy memory of the App. PDF files generally require
more memory than .txt files as well.

==== Summary
The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when user executes a `report d/DATE` command: +

.Activity Diagram for Report command
image::ReportActivityDiagram.png[]


=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>> below)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the App
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the App can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

// tag::helpcommand[]
=== Command guide `help` command

==== Implementation

As with any application with a plethora of commands, it is useful to have an in-app and offline method by which users can view the purpose and usage format of each command.

This help feature is a functionality that is carried out by the FoodRecordParser to guide users on how to utilise the App's commands. The guide is displayed in a separate window, as handled by HelpWindow.

With this, a top-level idea of the execution of the help command is given in the sequence diagram below:

.Sequence Diagram for Help Command
image::HelpSequenceDiagram.png[]
// end::helpcommand[]

Step 1: `LogicManager` takes in the user input of "help". +
Step 2: `FoodRecordParser` is passed the String input and is parsed using `parseCommand`. +
Step 3: This results in a `HelpCommand` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`. +
Step 4: The `LogicManager` encapsulates the result as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `MainWindow`. +
Step 5: The `MainWindow` executes the handleHelp() method, displaying the `HelpWindow` if it is not already being displayed. +
Step 6: `HelpWindow` is displayed as a separate popup.

// end::helpcommand[]

==== Design consideration
===== Aspect: How Help is displayed
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `HelpWindow` is displayed as a self-contained popup.
** Pros: User can refer to the command guide in a window separately from the main app. Additionally, no internet access is required as all information on commands are stored offline.
** Cons: As `help` does not redirect to a url containing the most up-to-date User Guide, any changes to command functionality or addition of new commands must be updated for local display.
* **Alternative 2:** `HelpWindow` is not used, and instead content is displayed as part of `ResultDisplay`.
** Pros: No possibility of a popup blocking the main app, and all information is contained within a single window.
** Cons: User must use the `help` command every time they require a guide, as `ResultDisplay` will be overwritten after every command.

==== Summary
`help` will produce a popup, displaying a guide on the App's available commands' purposes and usage format.
