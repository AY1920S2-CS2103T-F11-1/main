== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the Calgo Application. From now on, all instances of Calgo Application will be referred to as App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/tree/master/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

The `Main` component has two classes called link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/life/calgo/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/life/calgo/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. This component is responsible for:

* Launching App: Initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* Exiting App: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
In particular, the `LogsCenter` class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The User Interface (UI).
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: The in-memory representation of the App data.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: The file manager for reading from and writing to the hard disk.

Each of the four components:

* Defines its _Application Programming Interface (API)_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/tree/master/src/main/java/life/calgo/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `FoodListPanel`, `DailyListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/life/calgo/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component:

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/life/calgo/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a food).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/life/calgo/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Food Record data.
* exposes both unmodifiable `ObservableList<Food>` and `ObservableList<ConsumedFood>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Food Record`, which `Food` can reference. This would allow `Food Record` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Food` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:BetterModelClassDiagram.png[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/life/calgo/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component can do the following:

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back for the next session.
* can save `FoodRecord` data in json format and read it back for the next session.
* generate insights `report` based on user food consumption.
* generate a user-friendly version of the current `FoodRecord`.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `life.calgo.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.


// tag::lexicographicallistcommand[]
=== Lexicographical `list` Command
==== Implementation

With a large number of `Food` objects, it will be useful to see all entries sorted in lexicographic order. +

The `list` command is therefore one of the most commonly used in `Calgo`, especially after a `find` command. However, it simply shows all current `Food` entries in the `Model`, and does not perform sorting.

Sorting by lexicographic order is done by the `UniqueFoodList`, containing `Food` which implements the `Comparable<Food>` interface. +

* `Food` objects are arranged in lexicographic order by `Name`.
* `UniqueFoodList` sorts the `Food` whenever they are added or edited in the `Model`.

With this, a top-level idea of the execution of the lexicographical `list` command is given in the sequence diagram below:

image::ListCommandSequenceDiagram.png[]

Step 1: `UI` detects that the user has entered a `String`. +
Step 2: `UI` passes this `String` into `Logic` to eventually produce a `ListCommand`. +
Step 3: `Logic` executes the `ListCommand` to filter out relevant `Food` entries from the `Model`. +
Step 4: All `Food` entries are shown in the GUI. +
Step 5: `Logic` produces a `CommandResult` which displays its status in the GUI.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Sort whenever `Food` is added or edited in the `Model`.
** Pros: Will guarantee correctness of sorting. Furthermore, since `Food` objects are sorted whenever they are added or edited one by one, each sorting operation will not be too expensive.
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementations of each individual underlying command are correct and do not interfere with the sorting process. Moreover, this may be expensive if there are many unsorted `Food` objects at once, which is seldom the case.
* **Alternative 2:** Sort only when calling the `list` command.
** Pros: Easier to implement, may be less computationally expensive.
** Cons: May lead to certain bugs, especially during adding or editing such as through the `update` command. Also, not guaranteed to work when reading in from `foodrecord.json` for the next session.

===== Aspect: Data structure to store `Food` objects

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use `UniqueFoodList` to store all `Food` objects.
** Pros: Any changes to the `Model` are automatically reflected in the GUI. This is very useful for testing and debugging manually. Also, we do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Many of the underlying `ObservableList` methods are built-in and cannot be edited. They are also difficult to understand for those unfamiliar. This can make development slightly trickier, especially in following certain software engineering principles.
* **Alternative 2:** Use a simpler data structure like an `ArrayList`.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: More troublesome as we to implement methods to display on the GUI. Also, the methods create a risk to violations of certain software engineering principles, if not careful. These methods are also subject to being changed which can introduce regression in the future.

==== Summary

`list` will make the GUI display a lexicographically sorted list of `Food` previously entered. This can be exemplified in an activity diagram below:

image::ListActivityDiagram.png[]
// end::lexicographiclistcommand[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>> below)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the App
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the App can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).
