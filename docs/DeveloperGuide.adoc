== About this guide

This Developer Guide is a document to guide future software developers of the Calgo App by providing a sufficient and comprehensible overview of the project. +
While we aim to provide a reasonable amount of depth, the goal of this document is not to serve as a replacement for reading the actual code. +
Welcome on-board the Software Development Team for Calgo!

== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in
the link:{repoURL}/tree/master/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above describes the high-level design of the Calgo Application. From now on, all
instances of Calgo Application will be referred to as App.
Given below is a quick overview of each component.

The `Main` component comprises of two classes called link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/life/calgo/Main.java[`Main`] and
link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/life/calgo/MainApp.java[`MainApp`].
This component is responsible for:

* Launching App: Initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* Exiting App: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<<

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
In particular, the `LogsCenter` class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Writes log messages to the App's log file, for various classes.

The rest of the App comprises of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The User Interface (UI).
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: The in-memory representation of the App data.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: The file manager for reading from and writing to the hard disk.

Each of the four components:

* Defines its _Application Programming Interface (API)_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete n/Apple`.

.Component interactions for `delete n/Apple` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

<<<

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/tree/master/src/main/java/life/calgo/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `FoodListPanel`, `DailyListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/life/calgo/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component:

. Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
. Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

<<<

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/life/calgo/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `FoodRecordParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a food).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete n/Apple")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete n/Apple` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

<<<

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/life/calgo/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

. `Model` stores user's preferences in a `UserPref` object.
. `Model` also stores Food Record data.
. This component exposes both `ObservableList<Food>` and `ObservableList<ConsumedFood>`. The data stored in
these two list objects is reflected in UI. Therefore, any changes made to the data in these lists are shown in the UI in
real-time.
. To update the `Model` (and hence reflect the changes in the UI), `Food` attributes need to satisfy certain `Predicates`, which represent these changes.
. This component does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
To make `Model` follow the Object Oriented Programming (OOP) Paradigm more closely,
we can store a `Tag` list in `Food Record`, which `Food` objects can reference.
This would allow `Food Record` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`,
instead of each `Food` needing their own `Tag` object.
An example of how such a model may look like is given in the below diagram. +
 +

.Structure of the Model Component

<<<

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/life/calgo/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component allows us to save `FoodRecord`, `UserPref`, `Goal`, and `ConsumptionRecord`  data in json format onto the disk, and read them back later on during the next session.

This would facilitate the following functions:

. Load past user App data and preferences.
. Generate and save insights reports based on previously and currently recorded user consumption.
. Generate and save a user-friendly version of the accumulated `FoodRecord`.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `life.calgo.commons` package.

<<<

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the App can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

// tag::helpcommand[]
[[Implementation-HelpGuide]]
=== Command guide `help` command

==== Implementation

As with any application with a plethora of commands, it is useful to have an in-app and offline method by which users can view the purpose and usage format of each command.

This help feature is a functionality that is carried out by the FoodRecordParser to guide users on how to utilise the App's commands. The guide is displayed in a separate window, as handled by HelpWindow.

With this, a top-level idea of the execution of the help command is given in the sequence diagram below:

.Sequence Diagram for Help Command
image::HelpSequenceDiagram.png[]
// end::helpcommand[]

Step 1: `LogicManager` takes in the user input of "help". +
Step 2: `FoodRecordParser` is passed the String input and is parsed using `parseCommand`. +
Step 3: This results in a `HelpCommand` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`. +
Step 4: The `LogicManager` encapsulates the result as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `MainWindow`. +
Step 5: The `MainWindow` executes the handleHelp() method, displaying the `HelpWindow` if it is not already being displayed. +
Step 6: `HelpWindow` is displayed as a separate popup.

// end::helpcommand[]

==== Design considerations
===== Aspect: How Help is displayed
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `HelpWindow` is displayed as a self-contained popup.
** Pros: User can refer to the command guide in a window separately from the main app. Additionally, no internet access is required as all information on commands are stored offline.
** Cons: As `help` does not redirect to a url containing the most up-to-date User Guide, any changes to command functionality or addition of new commands must be updated for local display.
* **Alternative 2:** `HelpWindow` is not used, and instead content is displayed as part of `ResultDisplay`.
** Pros: No possibility of a popup blocking the main app, and all information is contained within a single window.
** Cons: User must use the `help` command every time they require a guide, as `ResultDisplay` will be overwritten after every command.

===== Aspect: Command guides can be selectively displayed
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `help` displays all command guides by default. User can selectively filter to display only desired commands by entering an optional keyword after `help`.
** Pros: User can filter out command guides they know they aren't looking for, thus having a more focused display.
** Cons: If user does not know the name of the command they want, the filtered `help` is not useful.
* **Alternative 2:** Always display all command guides to ensure user will find the guide they require.
** Pros: No possibility of user being unable to find their desired command after sufficient searching.
** Cons: Can be very overwhelming and frustrating to search through, should an experienced user be using the app.

==== Summary
`help` will produce a popup, displaying a guide on the App's available commands' purposes and usage format.

// tag::categoricalsubstringfindsearch[]
[[Implementation-FindList]]
=== Searching for specific `Food` via categories and substrings
(by Eugene)

This section addresses how the `find` and `list` commands work. These commands are complementary to one another.

The `find` command allows us to search through the `FoodRecord` (via categorical or substring search) based on what the user enters for the `Prefix`. Users may only enter 1 and only 1 `Prefix`. These search results can then be shown in the GUI's `Food Record`.

[NOTE]
`Prefix` here indicates which `Food` attribute we are interested in. Categorical search implies searching via `Calorie`, `Protein`, `Carbohydrate`, or `Fat`, while substring search implies searching via a substring which appears in any part of the the `Name` or in any part of any one of the `Tag` objects of the `Food`.

The `list` command allows us to reset the GUI's `Food Record` to once again show all the `Food` entries in lexicographical order, and can be thought of as the reverse of a `find` command. The `list` command does not use any `Prefix`, and ignores anything after the 'find' keyword entered by the user in the GUI.

[NOTE]
For more information on lexicographical ordering, please refer to its relevant section <<Implementation-LexicographicOrder, here>>.

`FindCommand` and `ListCommand` both use a `Predicate<Food>` and the GUI's `Food Record` will eventually show `Food` entries that evaluate these predicates to be true.

==== Implementation
To search via a particular `Food` attribute, we use the `FindCommandParser` (which matches the user-entered `Prefix` with the corresponding user-entered arguments) to create the corresponding `Predicate<Food>` based on the type of `Prefix` entered. This predicate is then used to construct a `FindCommand`, which upon execution, changes the GUI display.
The class diagram below shows the relevant `Predicate<Food>` used in the construction of `FindCommand` objects. Note that only relevant information is shown.

image::FindListCommandPredicateClassDiagram.png[]
.Class Diagram showing the relevant predicates used in constructing `FindCommand` objects

As seen in the above class diagram, each `Predicate<Food>` is specific to an attribute of `Food` and has a dependency to their related attribute. Moreover, each of these predicates test against a `Food` object, and therefore have a dependency on `Food`.

The sequence diagram below demonstrates how the `find` command works, for both categorical searching and substring searching:

image::FindSequenceDiagram.png[]
.Sequence Diagram for `find` command: categorical search and substring search

From the above, it is clear that both categorical search and substring search of the `find` command have similar steps: +

Step 1: `LogicManager` executes the user input, using `CalgoParser` to realise this is a `find` command, and creates a `FindCommandParser`. +

Step 2: `FindCommandParser` parses the user-entered arguments that come after the `Prefix`, creating the respective `Predicate<Food>` which depends on which `Prefix` has been entered. A new `FindCommand` object is then made from this predicate, and returned to `LogicManager`. +

- In the above diagram example, a `ProteinContainsKeywordsPredicate` is created for categorical search via `Protein` while a `NameContainsKeywordPredicate` is created for substring search. +

Step 3: `LogicManager` calls the `execute` method on the `FindCommand` created, which filters out `Food` objects that satisfy the predicate created and returns a new `CommandResult` object reflecting the status of the execution. These changes are eventually reflected in the GUI's `Food Record`.

The `find` command therefore searches through the existing `FoodRecord` and then displays the relevant search results in the GUI's `Food Record`. To once again show all `Food` entries in the display, we use the `list` command.

In constrast to the `FindCommand`, the `ListCommand` takes in no arguments and simply uses `Model.PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_FOODS` defined in the `Model` interface, as it must always show all `Food` entries. This is described by the sequence diagram below:

image::ListSequenceDiagram.png[]
.Sequence Diagram for `list` command

How the `list` command works:

Step 1: `LogicManager` executes the user input, using `CalgoParser` to realise this is a `list` command and creates a new `ListCommand` object. +

Step 2: `LogicManager` then calls the `execute` method on this `ListCommand`, which uses `Model.PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_FOODS` which evaluates to true for all `Food` objects in the `FoodRecord`.

Step 3: The GUI's `Food Record` reflects the above changes to show all `Food` entries.

<<<

==== Design considerations

===== Aspect: Predicate construction source

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Each `Predicate<Food>` is created using a new object of type either `Name`, `Calorie`, `Protein`, `Carbohydrate`, `Fat`, `Tag`.
** Pros:
- Models objects well to reflect real-world.
- Defensive programming by building new objects rather than relying on mutable sources.
- Can reuse existing code and classes like ArgumentMultimap and their methods.
** Cons:
- May be more resource-intensive
- New developers may not find this intuitive
* **Alternative 2:** Each `Predicate<Food>` is created using a `String` which represents the keywords.
** Pros:
- Easier to implement with fewer existing dependencies.
- Less resource-intensive.
** Cons:
- More prone to bugs.
- More difficult to debug as `String` type is easily modified.
- Does not reflect good Object-Oriented Programming practices

===== Aspect: Enabling substring search

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Allow substring search for both `Name` and `Tag`
** Pros:
- Improved user experience.
- Can reuse some underlying code as the approach for both `Name` and `Tag` are similar.
** Cons:
- Require good understanding of `String` type and manipulation.
* **Alternative 2:** Only allow exact word matches for `Name` and `Tag`
** Pros:
- Can simply reuse large parts of Address Book 3 existing code.
- Less prone to bugs.
- Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons:
- Diminishes user experience.
- Does not satisfy the full user requirements.

==== Summary

The `UniqueFoodList` facilitates the lexicographical ordering of `Food` objects and hence their appearance in the GUI `Food Record`. This can be summarised in an activity diagram below:

[[Implementation-ConsumptionManagement]]
=== `Food` consumption management
In Calgo, you will find that there is a date associated with each list of `ConsumedFood`.
When adding food to be consumed, removing food, or displaying food consumed on certain days,
a `FilteredList` will be populated with relevant `ConsumedFood`.

==== Implementation
The `nom`, `vomit` and `stomach` commands are facilitated by the `FoodRecord`.  +
`FoodRecord` contains a `UniqueDateToLogMap`, which maps a `LocalDate` to a `DailyFoodLog`. +
`DailyFoodLog` contains a `LinkedHashMap` storing `Food` in the sequence that they were consumed and maps those `Food` to a `Double` portion.

This section covers how the `nom` command is implemented. The `vomit` and `stomach` commands work in very similar way, hence their implementation is omitted for brevity.

A top-level illustration of the execution of a `nom` command is given in the sequence diagram below:

image:NomSequenceDiagram.png[]

Step 1: User enters a command, which is saved as a `String` and passed into the `LogicManager`. +
Step 2: The `String` cascades down the layers of abstraction until `NomCommandParser` handles it and creates a
`DailyFoodLog` which reflects the consumption. +
Step 3: A `NomCommand` is created and executed, updating both `ModelManager` and `FoodRecord` about the consumed food. +
Step 4: A `FilteredList` in `ModelManger` will then check with `FoodRecord` to create `ConsumedFood` items to display in the Graphical User Interface (GUI). +
Step 5: The GUI automatically detects changes in `FilteredList` and refreshes to display updated content.

<<<

==== Design considerations

===== Aspect: How `nom` executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create a new `DailyFoodLog` to pass into `ModelManager` and `FoodRecord`.
** Pros: Maintain comprehensive layers of abstraction and allows code to be easily testable.
** Cons: Difficult for newcomers or even existing users to trace because of long execution path.

* **Alternative 2:** Bypass `ModelManager` or even not use `FoodRecord` for storage of data during runtime by allowing everything to be done
from parser.
** Pros: Reduce dependencies on `ModelManager` and `FoodRecord`, and make code contained in a single class file easier to navigate.
** Cons: Violates layers of abstraction set in place by previous structure of AddressBook3. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and reduce
cohesiveness of code.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the consumption commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a single `FilteredList` to store food for any day by repopulating it each time
a consumption related command is used.
** Pros: Only uses a single `FilteredList`, so it is clear which list you are using for display.
** Cons: May have performance issue in terms of speed when there are too many entries.

* **Alternative 2:** Use a `FilteredList` for each date, to store food consumed on that date.
** Pros: Faster retrieval for display of `ConsumedFood` items. However, under practical circumstances, the difference is negligible.
** Cons: May have performance issue in terms of storage because it requires many lists to be stored in addition to `LinkedHashMap`
in `DailyFoodLog` for each `LocalDate`.

==== Summary

The `nom` command adds a `Food` item consumed by the user into the `stomach`. The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when the user executes a `nom` command.

.Activity Diagram for Nom

//tag:: Report[]
[[Implementation-InsightsReport]]
=== Generate insights report
This feature allows a user to generate a report that contains statistics and deliverable insights based on
personal food consumption patterns.

The functionality can be invoked by entering the `report d/DATE` command.
This command generates a report that is based on the food consumed by
the user on the specified date.

==== Implementation
The specified feature is facilitated by `ReportGenerator` class in the `Storage` component.
In this section, the implementation features of the `ReportGenerator` class will be further explained.

`ReportGenerator` class implements the following operation:

* `ReportGenerator#generateReport()` - Creates report containing an analysis of all food consumed by user on the
given date when inputting the `report` command.

Whenever the `report d/DATE` command is given by the user, the `ReportGenerate#generateReport()` operation is called.

<<<

The following sequence diagram illustrates the top-level execution of the `generateReport()` operation:

image::ReportFeatureSequenceDiagram.png[]

Step 1: User inputs `report d/2020-03-27` to generate the insights report based on food consumption of 27 March 2020. +

Step 2: This input is saved as a `String` and passed into the `LogicManager`. +

Step 3: The `String` input is parsed by `FoodRecordParser`, which removes the "d/" prefix tag and sends
the date input to `ReportCommandParser`. +

Step 4: Once the `ReportCommandParser` checks that the given date is valid, it creates a `ReportCommand` object and
returns it to `LogicManager`.

Step 5: `LogicManager` then executes the `ReportCommand`.

Step 6: From `Model`, `ReportCommand` retrieves the `DailyFoodLog` object that stores all `Food` consumed on the input date.

Step 7: From `Model`, `ReportCommand` also retrieves `DailyGoal` object, which stores the daily number of calories the user wants to consume.

Step 8: With the relevant objects retrieved from Steps 6 and 7, `ReportCommand` constructs a
`ReportGenerator` object.

Step 9: Using the `ReportGenerator` object, `ReportCommand` calls `#generateInsights()`, which prints metainformation
, food-wise statistics, aggregate statistics and insights based on the `DailyFoodLog` of the input date.

Step 10: This newly generated report is saved in the `/reports` folder. If the report is successfully generated,
the `CommandResult` is true. Otherwise, it is false. This `CommandResult` object is finally returned to `LogicManager`,
to signify the end of the command.

<<<

==== Design considerations

===== Aspect: How generate report executes

* *Alternative 1 (current choice):* Print insights into a .txt file.

** Pros: The implementation allows users to easily edit the contents of the report should they have realised they
did not log in certain food items on that day.
** Cons: Users could cheat by modifying values in the report. This defeats the purpose of the report to improve their
self-awareness of their food consumption patterns.

* *Alternative 2:* Print insights into a pdf file.
** Pros: The insights appear more legitimate and neatly formatted.

** Cons: Requires use of external libraries, which occupy memory of the App. PDF files generally require
more memory than .txt files as well.

==== Summary

// tag::lexicographicalordering[]
[[Implementation-LexicographicOrder]]
=== Lexicographical `Food` order
(by Eugene)

This section addresses how the GUI `Food Record` entries appear in lexicographical order, which is an effect of sorting `Food` objects in the `FoodRecord`.

Over time, users will eventually have many `Food` entries -- these should be sorted for a better experience. Intuitively, the lexicographical order is the most suitable here.

In essence, `Food` objects are sorted by the `UniqueFoodList` (which is inside `FoodRecord`).
Sorting is performed each time `Food` object(s) are newly added to the `UniqueFoodList`, edited by the user, or when the `UniqueFoodList` is initialised during App start-up.
There is no need to re-sort during deletion as the order is maintained.

[NOTE]
For a better understanding of adding and editing `Food` objects using the `update` command, please refer to its relevant section <<Implementation-SmartUpdate, here>>.
[NOTE]
Although the the `list` command changes the GUI `Food Record` display, it does not actually perform sorting. It simply resets the GUI `Food Record` to show all `Food` entries, and is usually used after a `find` command.

==== Implementation

The `UniqueFoodList` is able to sort `Food` objects because the `Food` class implements the `Comparable<Food>` interface.
This allows us to specify the lexicographical order for sorting `Food` objects via their `Name`, using the following compareTo method in the `Food` class:
[source,java]
----
public int compareTo(Food other) {
    String currentName = this.getName().toString();
    String otherName = other.getName().toString();
    return currentName.compareTo(otherName);
}
----

How the sorting process works:

* When the App starts up, a new `UniqueFoodList` is created from the source json file (if available) or otherwise the default entries, and the created `Food` objects are sorted as they are added to it.
* Existing `Food` objects are therefore arranged in lexicographic order by `Name`.
* Thereafter, `UniqueFoodList` sorts the `Food` whenever they are added or edited in the `Model`.

The sequence diagram below shows how the lexicographical ordering is performed when Calgo starts up:

image::LexicographicalOrderingStartupSequenceDiagram.png[]
.Lexicographical Ordering Sequence Diagram for App Start-up

Based on the above diagram, when Calgo starts: +
Step 1: We initialise the `ModelManager`. For this, we use previously stored user data if available. Otherwise, we use the default Calgo `Food` entries. +
Step 2: In creating a `ModelManager`, we require the creation of a `FoodRecord` which requires the creation of a `UniqueFoodList`. +
Step 3: The next step in the creation of the `FoodRecord` is the introduction of the initialising data, into the `UniqueFoodList`. Here, the `sortInternalList` method sorts the `ObservableList<Food>` contained in `UniqueFoodList` according to the specified lexicographical order defined in the `Food` class.


The sequence diagram below (a reference frame omitting irrelevant `update` command details) describes the main sorting process when `Food` objects are added or edited using the `update` command:

image::LexicographicalOrderingUpdateSequenceDiagram.png[]
.Lexicographical Ordering Sequence Diagram for Updating (Note: this is in a reference frame as it is reused in the `update` section <<Implementation-SmartUpdate, here>>)


Based on the above diagram, after parsing the user input and creating an `UpdateCommand` object:

* If the user-entered `Food` already exists in `UniqueFoodList`:
- Step 1: `UpdateCommand` calls `getExistingFood` method of `ModelManager` for the user-entered `Food`, which then calls that of `FoodRecord`, and subsequently that of `UniqueFoodList` to eventually obtain an existing `Food` object with an equivalent `Name`. +
- Step 2: Using the same sequence of classes, we call the respective `setFood` methods, eventually setting the desired `Food` object and arriving at the `sortInternalList` method of `UniqueFoodList`. +
- Step 3: The `sortInternalList` method then sorts the `ObservableList<Food>` contained in `UniqueFoodList` according to the specified lexicographical order defined in the `Food` class.

* Otherwise, the user-entered `Food` is an entirely new `Food` object:
- Step 1: Using the same sequence of classes as the former case, we call the respective `addFood` and `add` methods of the classes, eventually adding the `Food` object and arriving at the `sortInternalList` method of `UniqueFoodList`. +
- Step 2: The `sortInternalList` method then sorts the `ObservableList<Food>` contained in `UniqueFoodList` according to the specified lexicographical order defined in the `Food` class.

Any re-ordering will eventually be reflected in the GUI using the following (or its similar):
[source,java]
----
model.updateFilteredFoodRecord(Model.PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_FOODS);
----
This allows for the GUI `Food Record` to be updated in real-time, once the user makes the changes to the `Model`.

<<<

==== Design considerations

===== Aspect: Frequency of sorting operation

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Sort whenever a new `Food` is added or edited.
** Pros:
- Guarantees correctness of sorting.
- Saves on computational cost by not sorting during deletion as the order is maintained.
- Computational cost is not too expensive since the introduced `Food` objects usually come individually rather than as a collection (except during App start-up).
** Cons:
- Need to ensure implementations of various commands changing the `Model` are correct and do not interfere with the sorting process.
- May be computationally expensive if there are many unsorted `Food` objects at once, which is possible when Calgo starts up.
* **Alternative 2:** Sort only when calling the `list` command.
** Pros:
- Easier to implement with fewer existing dependencies.
- Uses less computational resources since sorting is only done when `list` command is called.
** Cons:
- Diminishes user experience.
- May lead to bugs in overall product involving order of `Food` objects.
- May be incompatible with certain `Storage` functionalities.

===== Aspect: Data structure to store `Food` objects

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use `UniqueFoodList` to store all `Food` objects.
** Pros:
- Any changes to the `Model` are automatically reflected in the GUI. This is very useful for testing and debugging manually.
- Removes the need to maintain a separate list-like data structure, simply reusing what is already in the codebase.
** Cons:
- Many of the underlying `ObservableList` methods are built-in and cannot be edited. They are also difficult to understand for those unfamiliar. This can make development slightly trickier, especially in following certain software engineering principles.
* **Alternative 2:** Use a simpler data structure like an `ArrayList`.
** Pros:
- Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons:
- More troublesome as we require self-defined methods, abstracted over the existing ones. If not careful, these self-defined methods can possibly contain violations of certain software engineering principles, which may introduce regression in the future.

==== Summary

The `UniqueFoodList` facilitates the lexicographical ordering of `Food` objects and hence their appearance in the GUI `Food Record`. This can be summarised in an activity diagram below:

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>> below)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the App

[[Implementation-SmartUpdate]]
=== Updating `FoodRecord`
This feature allows you to add a food preset with all its nutritional details into the `FoodRecord`.
This makes it convenient for you to keep track of your `Food` consumed in the day without having to manually key in the nutritional details every time you do so.

==== Implementation
The update mechanism is facilitated by `FoodRecord` and `UpdateCommand`. An additional operation was implemented into `FoodRecord`:

* `FoodRecord#hasExistingFood()` - Checks if there is an existing `Food` in `FoodRecord` based on its name only

This operation was exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#hasExistingFood()`.

The update feature first checks if there is already an existing `Food` item with the same name
inside `FoodRecord` using the method `FoodRecord#hasExistingFood()`.

If there is already an existing `Food` with the same name, the existing `Food` item will override the `Food` item inside `FoodRecord` with
the new nutritional information provided by the user. +
Otherwise, the new `Food` item will be added into the `FoodRecord`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the update operation works in both cases:

NOTE: The lifeline for `UpdateCommandParser` and `UpdateCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

==== Design considerations

===== Aspect: Updating the `FoodRecord` when there is an existing `Food` item in `FoodRecord`

* *Alternative 1 (current choice):* Overrides the existing `Food` item with the new `Food` item
** Pros: No need for a separate command of `edit` to deal with existing `Food` item apart from `add` to add new `Food` item into the `FoodRecord`.
Instead, a smarter command of `update` is used to deal with both scenarios.
** Cons:
This might not be intuitive for the user since the word "update" is generally assumed to be for editing something only, and not necessarily adding something.

* *Alternative 2:* Informs the user that there is already an existing `Food` item, and direct him to use another function `edit` to edit the existing `Food` instead.
** Pros: In the event where the user is unaware that there is already an existing `Food` item, this two step process will be clearer to him that he is
in fact editing a `Food` item and not adding a new one in.
** Cons: This is more tedious for the user since more steps is required to change an existing `Food` item. On top of that, an additional command of `edit` will be required and `update`
should be replaced with `add` for clearer user experience.

==== Summary
The `update` command is a smart command that either updates an existing `Food` item in the `FoodRecord` with new nutritional information,
or updates a new `Food` item into the `FoodRecord`
The following activity diagram summarises what happens when a user enters a valid `update` command:

[[Implementation-CalorieGraph]]
=== Past seven days calorie data graph
This feature displays to the user a summary of their past seven days' daily total calorie consumption in the form of a line graph.
Specifically, the graph shows the calorie consumption for the date of the `DailyList`, and the six days before it.

This functionality is automatic. The graph will always display the past seven days' data at the bottom of the app, and will update
whenever app data is changed.

==== Implementation
This feature is facilitated by the `GraphPanel` class in the `Ui` component.

`GraphPanel` contains a `LineChart` of `String` date against `Number` calories, and is populated with
data from an `XYChart.series`. The data is in turn obtained from the `Logic` component, which provides only the past seven days'
of `DailyFoodLog`. The implementation of the `GraphPanel` class will be further explained.

`GraphPanel` class implements the following operations:

* `GraphPanel#initialiseTreeMap(Logic logic)` - Sets up the TreeMap that maps `LocalDate` date of `DailyFoodLog` to the `Double`
total calorie consumption n that day.
* `GraphPanel#initialseGraph()` - Sets up the `LineChart` with xAxis a `String` representing date, and yAxis a `Double` representing
total calories consumed on that date.
* `GraphPanel#updateSeries()` - Ensures the `XYChart.series` that populates the graph with data is always updated with the
most recent app data.
* `GraphPanel#makeGraph(Logic logic)` - Wrapper function that calls the above three methods.
* `GraphPanel#getGraph(Logic logic)` - Public accessor function to generate and retrieve the `LineChart`.

Calgo will display the past seven days' graph automatically, and likewise update automatically. It does so by having `MainWindow`
call `GraphPanel#getGraph(Logic logic)` on startup and after execution of commands.
