== Introduction

Calgo is an *all-in-one smart calorie tracker* to ensure that you are always one step ahead in your fitness goals.

* For the modern day user who prefers to use a *desktop application*, Calgo's *Command Line Interface (CLI)* works seamlessly with its *Graphical User Interface (GUI)* to provide fast and accurate usage while presenting results with visual depth and clarity.
* Fast typists would therefore greatly benefit from not only the speed of processing their input via the CLI but also the input correction methods of Calgo.

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `calgo.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Calgo application.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  You can try experimenting to see the results for yourself! Some example commands:

* *`list`* : lists all Food items currently recorded in the Food Records.
* **`update**n/kiwi cal/125 p/1 c/20 f/3` : adds `kiwi` to the Food Records if there is currently no Food called 'kiwi' inside it, with its details saved as: 125 calorie, 1 gram of protein, 20 grams of carbohydrates, and 3 grams of fats.
* **`find`**`banana` : finds the entry banana in the Food Records and returns its details if available; otherwise an error message will be shown.
* *`exit`* : exits the Calgo application

.  Refer to <<Features>> section below for details of each command.

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/kiwi`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/kiwi t/favourite fruit` or as `n/kiwi`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be left empty, or used as `t/favourite`, `t/favourite t/green` etc.
