[[Commands]]
== Commands

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are parameters that are to be supplied by you
** e.g. in `n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter. `n/kiwi` would mean that the name of the `Food` is 'kiwi'.
* Items in square brackets (i.e. []) are optional
** e.g. in `[t/TAG]`, `TAG` is an optional parameter which can be used as `t/fruit` to tag the `Food` as a 'fruit'.
* Parameters can be given in any order, as long as the correct prefix appears before the parameter
** e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PROTEINS`, `p/PROTEINS n/NAME` gives the same functionality.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times (including zero times)
** e.g. `[t/TAG]...` implies it can be left empty, or used as `t/favourite`, `t/favourite t/green` or with more than 2 tags.
====

TIP: As you begin to key in the name of the `Food` for any of these commands: `update`, `delete`, or `nom`, Calgo shows you
`Food` with similar names that exists in the `Food Record`.

=== Clearing all entries : `clear`

Clears all `Food` entries from the `Food Record`. +
Format: `clear` +
(any parameters entered are ignored)

=== Consuming `Food` consumed on a certain day : `nom`
(by Ruicong)
The `nom` command allows you to keep track of your consumption on certain date. +

Format: `nom n/NAME [d/DATE] [portion/PORTION][r/RATING]`

****
* If a date is not provided, Calgo will by default take it that you ate the `Food` today.
* Date follows yyyy-mm-dd format.
* If you decide not to include in `d/`, `portion/` or `r/` prefixes, Calgo will take it that those prefixes exist
but has no values provided. +
Not providing values can result in the following behavior:
1. Date will be today's date.
2. Portion will be 1.
3. This dining experience will not have a rating.
* Rating for food displayed is the its average rating, based on the ratings it received that day.
* You can check how much nutritional content each type of food content by checking the existing list of food.
* You can rate your dining experience, average rating of consuming a certain food will then be displayed.
****

Examples:

* `nom n/chicken d/2020-03-04 portion/1.5` +
Adds 1.5 portion of chicken to the log tracking user's consumption on 4th March 2020.
* `nom n/apple pie portion/2 r/7` +
Adds 2 portion of apple pie to the log tracking user's consumption today.
This consumption will be rated 7/10.

=== Deleting a `Food` from current `Food Record`: `delete`
(by Zhang Xian)

If you no longer require Calgo to store a particular `Food` and its nutritional values for you, this `delete` command
helps you with that.

Format: `delete n/NAME`

Example:

* `delete n/pizza` +
Deletes pizza from the `Food Record`.

=== Deleting `Food` consumed on a certain day : `vomit`
(by Ruicong)
Deletes a `Food` that a user has previously added to the log tracking consumption on that day.

Format: `vomit num/INDEX_OF_FOOD [d/DATE] [portion/PORTION]`

****
* Deletes a portion of food at the specified `INDEX_OF_FOOD`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed consumption list.
* The index *must be a positive integer*: 1, 2, 3, ...
* If you decide not to include in `d/` or `portion/` prefixes, Calgo will take it that those prefixes exist
but has no values provided. +
Not providing values can result in the following behavior:
1. Date will be today's date.
2. The whole entry is deleted.
* If user specified a portion greater than what he has consumed, the entire entry will be deleted.
* Date follows yyyy-mm-dd format.
* Vomiting a portion of food will not affect it's ratings. +
Suppose you gave a rating by mistake, you can use the `undo` command,
which will be available from version 2.0 onwards.
****

Examples:

* `stomach` +
`vomit num/2` +
Deletes the second food consumed today in the consumption log displayed using `stomach` command.

* `vomit num/1 d/2020-03-04 portion/3` +
Deletes 3 portions of of the first `Food` consumed on 2020-03-04.


=== Displaying `help` when lost : `help`

Displays a guide for all available commands in Calgo.

****
* This will display all available commands, in alphabetical order
* If only a specific command is wanted, `help` can used with a keyword.
****

Format: `help [COMMAND_WORD]`

Examples:

* `help` +
This command will display all available commands, along with their associated command format and a brief description of the command's purpose.
* `help list` +
This command will display only available commands containing the keyword 'list'.

=== Exiting the program : `exit`

Exits the program. +
Format: `exit`

=== Exporting the current `Food Record` into a reference sheet : `export`
(by Eugene) +

Obtaining a portable copy of the current `Food Record` may be useful for various purposes. For instance, you can conveniently share your `Food` entries with friends, print the `Food Record` for future reference, or even adapt it to suit your personal cooking needs in the kitchen. Whatever the purpose, we have you covered with the `export` command. +

The `export` command provides you with a neatly formatted, editable file that reflects all entries in the current `Food Record`. This file (FoodRecord.txt) will be created in the `data/exports` folder. +

Here are some key pointers for using the command:
****
* FoodRecord.txt shows the `Food Record` in alphabetical order of `Food` names, and includes the corresponding details of each `Food` neatly in a table.
* If a previous FoodRecord.txt file exists, do close any instances of the file (if previously opened) before running the `export` command. The file will be replaced by an updated version representing your latest `Food Record`.
* `Tags` are placed outside of the dashed lines.
****

[TIP]
This lets you manually track your diet using a reference sheet of your past `Food` entries. You can freely edit this reference sheet to include information outside of the App. +
[NOTE]
Certain `Food` names may be too long to fit into the given space. The reference sheet truncates these names and shows the remainder on the following lines. Rest assured that all your information is still captured and will be separated with space(s). Individual entries will also appear on separate lines.

Format: `export`

Example: +

Say you wish to export the current `Food Record` so that you can print a copy for reference while cooking.

image::ExportCommandBefore.png[width=]

You should first type in and enter the command, as seen above.

image::ExportCommandAfter.png[width=]

Doing so, *Calgo*  will show you a result message indicating the copy has been successfully generated.
You can find this copy (FoodRecord.txt) in the `data/exports` folder near the App.

<<<
[[FindCommand]]
=== Finding a `Food` entry by nutritional value or keyword(s) : `find`
(by Eugene) +

With many `Food` entries in the `Food Record`, it may be quite difficult to search for a particular `Food` entry you want. This is where the `find` command comes in nicely.

The `find` command shows all `Food` entries that have a nutritional value matching what you specify. This can be the number of `Calories`, or the number of grams of `Proteins`/`Carbohydrates`/`Fats`.

Alternatively, you can choose to search for a keyword which appears in any part of the `Name`, or in one of the `Tags` associated with a particular `Food` entry.

Here are some key pointers:
****
* The `find` command takes in one, and only one parameter.
* For finding via nutritional value, only `Food` matching the same exact value will be shown.
* To facilitate the possibility of typing errors made by fast typists, any additional input (separated by spaces) typed without a preceding prefix (e.g. `n/`, `p/`) will be ignored.
* The GUI changes as a result of using the `find` command. We can reset the `Food Record` to show all entries once again using the <<ListCommand, `list`>> command.
****

[TIP]
You don't have to capitalise each keyword. The search is always case insensitive when searching for keyword(s) via `Name` or `Tag`. +
[TIP]
You don't actually have to type out the entire keyword either. For your comfort, incomplete keywords will be matched to `Food` entries containing them in the specified parameter of `Name` or `Tag`. +
[TIP]
You can search for multiple `Name` keywords by using a single `n/` prefix, separating them with space(s). +

Format: `find [n/NAME] [cal/CALORIES] [p/PROTEINS] [c/CARBOHYDRATES] [f/FATS] [t/TAG]` +
(Reminder: choose only 1 parameter)

Examples: +

Example 1: Say you wish to search for a `Food` entry with 150 `Calories` because you are looking for a snack.

image::FindCommandCalorieBefore.png[width=]
You should first enter `find cal/150` as input and press enter. +

image::FindCommandCalorieAfter.png[width=]
Once the command has been entered, the `Result Display` shows the results of your command and the GUI's `Food Record` shows the relevant entries with 150 `Calories`.

Example 2: Say you wish to find entries which contain the keyword `Cheese` in their `Name`, but your hand slipped and the keyword only registered `Chees`. +

image::FindCommandSubstringBefore.png[width=]

You would therefore enter `find n/Chees` as the command input. +

image::FindCommandSubstringAfter.png[width=]

Once the command has been entered, the `Result Display` shows the results of your command and the GUI's `Food Record` shows the relevant entries which contain `Chees` in their `Name`. This is not too bad, as you still obtain entries that will be largely relevant.

Example 3: Say you are lazy but wish to find entries containing the keyword `sweet` in their `Tag`. +

image::FindCommandTagBefore.png[width=]

You could first enter `find t/swe` as input and press enter. +

image::FindCommandTagAfter.png[width=]

As the `find` command allows you to search using substrings, `Food` entries with `swe` in any one of their `Tags` would appear in the `Food Record`. Therefore, your original search for `sweet` would also have its results shown. +

Please note that the search is case-insensitive, as seen from the `Sweet` `Tag` of the result `Sambal Chilli`. Moreover, as with Example 2, we allow for incomplete words to be used as search keywords.

<<<

=== Generating insights : `report`
Given a date, the command generates a document (in txt format) of relevant insights about the user's food consumption
pattern of the same date. This file is stored in the `data/reports` folder.

Format: `report d/DATE`
****
* The report includes the following insights:
** All `Foods` consumed on the given date. For each `Food`, the following information will be included:
*** The name of the `Food` item.
*** Quantity consumed, for instance 3 servings.
*** Number of calories consumed from each `Food`.

** The total number of calories consumed in that day.
** The total number of carbohydrates, protein and fats consumed in that day.
** A curated Food plan that includes a healthy quantity of the user's favourite `Foods`,
while ensuring it meets user's daily calorie goal. (Coming in v1.4)
****

Example:

* `report d/27-03-2020` +
This generates a txt file containing the above-mentioned insights made on the consumption of  Food by the user, on 27th of March 2020.

// todo: add Screenshot of report
// todo: Graphical Report

[[ListCommand]]
=== Listing all `Food` in current `Food Record` : `list`
(by Eugene) +

With a large number of entries in the `Food Record`, you may remember that we can use the <<FindCommand, `find`>> command to narrow down our search. However, this filtered information is only useful for a short amount of time and we will usually want to view all entries in the `Food Record` again. This is where the `list` command comes in handy. +

The `list` command resets the display accordingly to show all entries in the `Food Record`. These will be neatly sorted in alphabetical order, just as the `Food Record` previously appeared:
****
* `Food` entries will once again be listed with all their corresponding details.
****

[TIP]
You can think of this as the undo of a `find` command.
After a `find` command, you are advised to complete your intended actions first, before using the `list` command to reset the display. This allows for a smoother workflow as you will now avoid the need to perform the same `find` command again.

Format: `list` +
(any parameters entered are ignored)

Example: Say you want to view all entries again after performing a `find n/Chicken` command.

image::ListCommandBefore.png[width=]

You should first enter `list` as input, and press enter.

image::ListCommandAfter.png[width=]

Doing so, you will see a result message displayed and the `Food Record` will now show all `Food` entries.

=== Setting a daily `Calorie` target : `goal`

What is the point of tracking your meals if you do not have an objective benchmark?

This command will help you to set a numerical goal for yourself, which is essentially the number of calories you want
to consume each day. Note that this goal must be a positive whole number.

Your goal will also be used to provide helpful insights regarding your consumption patterns. +

The range of acceptable values are: +

*  Minimum acceptable value: 1 +
* Maximum acceptable value: 99999

Format: `goal GOAL`

Example:

* `goal 2580` +
Sets the desired number of `Calorie` to be consumed to be 2580.

=== Showing all `Food` consumed on a particular day : `stomach`
(by Ruicong)

Displays a list of `Food` entries along side how many portions have been consumed on that day.
For a more detailed statistical report with nutritional values of `Food` consumed, see the `report` command.

Format: `stomach [d/DATE]`

****
* If a date is not provided, *Calgo* will assume that the user wishes to see `Food` consumed today.
* If you want to show today's records, inclusion of `d/` prefix is optional.
* Date follows yyyy-mm-dd format.
****

Examples:

* `stomach d/2020-03-04` +
Displays a list of `Food` user has consumed on 2020-03-04.

* `stomach` or `stomach d/` +
Displays a list of `Food` the user has consumed today.

=== Updating the current `Food Record` : `update`
(by Zhang Xian)

Your `Food Record` stores all the nutritional information of all the `Food` that you consume frequently. This `update` command helps you `update` your `Food Record` with either
a new `Food`  or `update` an existing `Food`  in the `Food Record`.

There is only two scenarios in which you will use this `update` command:

* Scenario 1: You want to update a new `Food`  into `Food Record`
** The `Food` , along with the nutritional values that you inputted will be added into the `Food Record` as a new `Food` .
* Scenario 2: You want to update an existing `Food` item in the `Food Record` with nutritional values
** The existing `Food`  in the `Food Record` will be updated with new nutritional values that you have inputted.

In both scenarios, we have kept the format the same for you: +
Format: `update n/NAME cal/CALORIES p/PROTEINS c/CARBOHYDRATES f/FATS [t/TAGS]`

Examples:

* `update n/pizza cal/200 p/10 c/200 f/200` +
This command adds a new `Food`, pizza into the user’s food presets with nutritional values of 200 `Calorie`, 10g of `Protein`, 200g of `Carbohydrate` and 200g of `Fat`.
* `update n/pizza cal/100 p/10 c/100 f/30 t/Italiano t/Favourite` +
As pizza already exists in the user’s `Food Record`, this command overrides the nutritional values of pizza with 200 `Calorie`, 10g of `Protein`, 200g of `Carbohydrate` and 20g of `Fat`.
The pizza is also tagged with the `Tag` "Italiano" and "Favourite" .

[NOTE]
As long as two Food items have the same name, they are deemed to be the same Food item! We suggest you to be as specific in naming your Food
item as much as possible. Instead of naming your Food "Chocolate", perhaps "White Chocolate" or "Dark Chocolate" would be a better idea!

== FAQ

*Q*: How do I transfer my *Calgo* data to another Computer? +
*A*: Install *Calgo* in a folder inside the target computer and copy over your current `data` folder into that folder.

*Q*: Where can I find my exported `Food Record` entries and consumption reports? +
*A*: They are both found in the `exports` and `reports` subfolders in the `data` folder respectively. Please do not remove the json files in the `data` folder. These are system files.
