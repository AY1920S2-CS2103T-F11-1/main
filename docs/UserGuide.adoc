== Introduction

Have you always wanted to live a healthy lifestyle, but never got to the stage where you would do it willingly yourself? Is it too troublesome to remember nutritional values, or too expensive to hire a personal assistant to keep track of your diet?

Fear not!

*Calgo* is an *all-in-one smart calorie tracker* to ensure that you are always one step ahead in your fitness goals!


* *Insights:* set goals, generate consumption reports and view progress and statistics

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window. +
- You can refer to <<Commands>> below for details of each command.
.  Try experimenting with the commands yourself! Here are some examples:

* **`update**n/kiwi cal/125 p/1 c/20 f/3` : adds `kiwi` to the `Food Record` if there is currently no `Food` called 'kiwi' inside it, with its details saved as: 125 calorie, 1 gram of protein, 20 grams of carbohydrates, and 3 grams of fats.
* **`find`**`n/banana`: finds the entry banana in the `Food Record` and returns its nutritional details if such a `Food` exists.
* *`list`* : lists all `Foods` currently recorded in the `Food Record`.

[[Commands]]
== Commands

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user
** e.g. in `n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `n/kiwi` to name the `Food` as 'kiwi'.
* Items in square brackets (i.e. []) are optional
** e.g. in `[t/TAG]`, `TAG` is an optional parameter which can be used as `t/fruit` to tag the `Food` as a 'fruit'.
* Parameters can be in any order, as long as the correct prefix appears before the parameter
** e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PROTEINS`, `p/PROTEINS n/NAME` gives the same functionality.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times (including zero times)
** e.g. `[t/TAG]...` implies it can be left empty, or used as `t/favourite`, `t/favourite t/green` or with more than 2 tags.
====

=== Clearing all entries : `clear`

Clears all `Food` entries from the `Food Record`. +
Format: `clear`

=== Consuming `Food` consumed on a certain day : `nom`

The `nom` command allows you to keep track of your consumption on certain date. +

Format: `nom [n/NAME] [d/DATE] [portion/PORTION][r/RATING]`

****
* If a date is not provided, Calgo will by default take it that you ate the `Food` today.
* Date follows yyyy-mm-dd format.
* If you decide not to include in `d/`, `portion/` or `r/` prefixes, Calgo will take it that those prefixes exist
but has no values provided. +
Not providing values can result in the following behavior:
1. Date will be today's date.
2. Portion will be 1.
3. This dining experience will not have a rating.
* Rating for food displayed is the its average rating, based on the ratings it received that day.
* You can check how much nutritional content each type of food content by checking the existing list of food.
* You can rate your dining experience, average rating of consuming a certain food will then be displayed.
****

Examples:

* `nom n/chicken d/2020-03-04 portion/1.5` +
Adds 1.5 portion of chicken to the log tracking user's consumption on 4th March 2020.
* `nom n/apple pie portion/2 r/7` +
Adds 2 portion of apple pie to the log tracking user's consumption today.
This consumption will be rated 7/10.

=== Deleting a `Food` from current `Food Record`: `delete`
Deletes the specified `Food` from the `Food Record`.

Format: `delete n/NAME`

Example:

* `delete n/pizza` +
Deletes pizza from the `Food Record`.

=== Deleting `Food` consumed on a certain day : `vomit`

Deletes a `Food` that a user has previously added to the log tracking consumption on that day.

Format: `vomit [num/INDEX_OF_FOOD] [d/DATE] [portion/PORTION]`

****
* Deletes a portion of food at the specified `INDEX_OF_FOOD`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed consumption list.
* The index *must be a positive integer*: 1, 2, 3, ...
* If you decide not to include in `d/` or `portion/` prefixes, Calgo will take it that those prefixes exist
but has no values provided. +
Not providing values can result in the following behavior:
1. Date will be today's date.
2. The whole entry is deleted.
* If user specified a portion greater than what he has consumed, the entire entry will be deleted.
* Date follows yyyy-mm-dd format.
* Vomiting a portion of food will not affect it's ratings. +
Suppose you gave a rating by mistake, you can use the `undo` command,
which will be available from version 2.0 onwards.
****

Examples:

* `stomach` +
`vomit num/2` +
Deletes the second food consumed today in the consumption log displayed using `stomach` command.

* `vomit num/1 d/2020-03-04 portion/3` +
Deletes 3 portions of of the first `Food` consumed on 2020-03-04.


=== Displaying `help` when lost : `help`

Displays a guide for all available commands in Calgo.

****
* This will display all available commands, in alphabetical order
* If only a specific command is wanted, `help` can used with a keyword.
****

Format: `help [COMMAND_WORD]`

Examples:

* `help` +
This command will display all available commands, along with their associated command format and a brief description of the command's purpose.
* `help list` +
This command will display only available commands containing the keyword 'list'.

=== Exiting the program : `exit`

Exits the program. +
Format: `exit`

=== Exporting the current `Food Record` into a reference sheet : `export`

Obtaining a copy of the `Food Record` entries may be useful for situations like sharing or printing.
While your entries are automatically saved in *Calgo*, the `export` command provides an editable text file (FoodRecords.txt) in the `data/exports` folder should you feel the need to obtain a portable version of the current `Food` entries inside the `Food Record`. +

* FoodRecords.txt shows the `Food Record` in alphabetical order of names, and includes the corresponding details of each `Food` neatly in a table.

[TIP]
This lets you manually track your diet using a reference sheet of your past `Food` entries. You can freely edit this reference sheet to include information outside of the App. +
[NOTE]
Certain `Food` names and nutritional values may be too long to fit into the given space. The reference sheet allows the storage of these entries by wrapping-around onto the next line. While some entries may be misaligned, fear not as your information will still be captured and separated by spaces. Individual entries will also appear on separate lines.

Format: `export`

<<<

=== Finding a `Food` by nutritional value or keyword(s) : `find`

With many `Food` entries in the `Food Record`, it may be difficult to search for a particular `Food` you want. This is where the `find` command comes in nicely.

The `find` command shows all the `Food` items with a nutritional value matching what you specify (either in terms of the number of `Calories`, or grams of `Proteins`/`Carbohydrates`/`Fat`).

Alternatively, you can choose to search for a keyword which may appear in, or as the actual `Name` of a `Food` or a particular `Tag` associated with it.

Please note that the `find` command takes in one and only 1 parameter.

Format: `find [n/NAME] [cal/CALORIES] [p/PROTEINS] [c/CARBS] [f/FATS] [t/TAG]` (choose only 1 parameter)

****
* In finding `Food` via nutritional value, only `Food` with exact matching values will be shown.
** e.g. `find cal/50` results will only contain `Food` entries with 50 `Calorie` s.
* Finding via `Name` or `Tag` is case insensitive.
** e.g `find n/Kiwi` results can contain both 'kiwi' and 'Kiwi'.
****

[TIP]
You don't actually have to type out the entire keyword. Incomplete keywords will be matched to `Food` items containing them in the specified parameter. +
e.g. `find t/Gre` can give 'Kiwi' and 'Sugarcane' which are tagged `Green`
[TIP]
You can search for multiple `Name` keywords by using a single `n/` prefix, separating them with space(s). +
e.g. `find n/Ki Jui` results can give 'Kiwi Ice Cream' (which contains 'Ki'), 'Orange Juice' (which contains 'Jui'), and so on.

Examples:

* `find n/kIWi` +
Returns `kiwi` and `kiwi juice`
* `find p/25` +
Returns `chocolate protein powder shake` and `vanilla protein milkshake` which both have 25 grams of protein.
* `find n/food_item_not_in_food_record` +
Returns a message indicating that 0 `Food` entries are listed.

<<<

=== Generating insights : `report`
Given a date, the command generates a document (in txt format) of relevant insights about the user's food consumption
pattern of the same date. This file is stored in the `data/reports` folder.

Format: `report d/DATE`
****
* The report includes the following insights:
** All `Foods` consumed on the given date. For each `Food`, the following information will be included:
*** The name of the `Food` item.
*** Quantity consumed, for instance 3 servings.
*** Number of calories consumed from each `Food`.

** The total number of calories consumed in that day.
** The total number of carbohydrates, protein and fats consumed in that day.
** A curated Food plan that includes a healthy quantity of the user's favourite `Foods`,
while ensuring it meets user's daily calorie goal. (Coming in v1.4)
****

Example:

* report `27-03-2020` +
This generates a txt file containing the above-mentioned insights made on the consumption of  Food by the user, on 27th of March 2020.

// todo: add Screenshot of report
// todo: Graphical Report

=== Listing all `Food` in current `Food Record` : `list`

To view a list of all `Food` s in the current `Food Record`, you can simply use the `list` command. +

* `Foods` will be listed in alphabetical order with their corresponding details. +

[TIP]
This resets the display to show all `Food` entries in the current `Food Record`, and is most useful after successfully executing a `find` command. +

Format: `list`

=== Setting a daily `Calorie` target : `goal`

This goal will be used to provide helpful insights for users. +

Format: `goal GOAL`

Example:

* `goal 2580` +
Sets the desired number of `Calorie` to be consumed to be 2580.

=== Showing all `Food` consumed on a particular day : `stomach`

Displays a list of `Food` entries along side how many portions have been consumed on that day.
For a more detailed statistical report with nutritional values of `Food` consumed, see the `report` command.

Format: `stomach [d/DATE]`

****
* If a date is not provided, *Calgo* will assume that the user wishes to see `Food` consumed today.
* If you want to show today's records, inclusion of `d/` prefix is optional.
* Date follows yyyy-mm-dd format.
****

Examples:

* `stomach d/2020-03-04` +
Displays a list of `Food` user has consumed on 2020-03-04.

* `stomach` or `stomach d/` +
Displays a list of `Food` the user has consumed today.

=== Updating the current `Food Record` : `update`

Updates a `Food` into the `Food Record`.

****
* If `Food` is not present in the `Food Record`, this will create a new `Food` with all the nutritional details specified
* If `Food` is already present in the `Food Record`, this will override that `Food` with all the nutritional details specified by user
****

Format: `update n/NAME cal/CALORIES p/PROTEINS] c/CARB] f/FATS [t/TAGS]`

Examples:

* `update n/pizza cal/200 p/10 c/200 f/200` +
This command adds a new `Food`, pizza into the user’s food presets with nutritional details of 200 `Calorie` s, 10g of `Protein` s, 200g of `Carbohydrate` s and 200g of `Fat` s.
* `update n/pizza cal/100 p/10 c/100 f/30 tags/Italiano` +
As pizza is already in the user’s `Food Record`, this command overrides the nutritional details of pizza with 200 `Calorie` s, 10g of `Protein` s, 200g of `Carbohydrate` s and 20g of `Fat` s.
The pizza is also tagged with the `Tag` "Italiano".


[TIP]
Whenever you begin to key in the name of the `Food`, Calgo automatically filters the display for you so that only `Food` s with
the same name are suggested. This helps you to easily refer to any existing `Food` you maybe updating.
