== Introduction

Calgo is an *all-in-one calorie tracker* with deliverable insights to ensure that you are always one step ahead in your fitness goals.

* For the modern day user who prefers to use a *desktop application*, Calgo's *Command Line Interface (CLI)* works seamlessly with its *Graphical User Interface (GUI)* to provide fast and accurate usage while presenting results with visual depth and clarity.
* Fast typists would therefore greatly benefit from not only the speed of processing their input via the CLI but also the input correction methods of Calgo.

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `calgo.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Calgo application.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window. +
- You can refer to <<Features>> below for details of each command.
.  Try experimenting with the commands yourself! Here are some examples:

* **`update**n/kiwi cal/125 p/1 c/20 f/3` : adds `kiwi` to the Food Records if there is currently no Food called 'kiwi' inside it, with its details saved as: 125 calorie, 1 gram of protein, 20 grams of carbohydrates, and 3 grams of fats.
* **`find`**`n/banana` or **`find`**`banana`: finds the entry banana in the Food Record and returns its details if available; otherwise an message reflecting no such Food item is shown.
* *`list`* : lists all Food items currently recorded in the Food Record.
* *`exit`* : exits the Calgo application

[[Features]]
== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user
** e.g. in `n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `n/kiwi` to name the Food item as 'kiwi'.
* Items in square brackets are optional
** e.g. in `[t/TAG]`, `TAG` is an optional parameter which can be used as `t/fruit` to tag the Food item as a 'fruit'.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times (including zero times)
** e.g. `[t/TAG]...` implies it can be left empty, or used as `t/favourite`, `t/favourite t/green` or with more than 2 tags.
* Parameters can be in any order, as long as the correct prefix appears before the parameter
** e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PROTEINS`, `p/PROTEINS n/NAME` gives the same functionality.
====

=== Displaying help : `help`

Displays a guide for all available commands in Calgo.

****
* This will display all available commands, in alphabetical order
* If only a specific command is wanted, `help` can used with a keyword.
****

Format: `help [KEYWORD]`

Examples:

* `help` +
This command will display all available commands, along with their associated command format and a brief description of the command's purpose.
* `help list` +
This command will display only available commands containing the keyword 'list'.

=== Updating the current Food Record : `update`

Updates a Food Item in the Food Record.

****
* If Food Item is not present in the Food Record, this will create a new Food Item with all the nutritional details specified
* If Food Item is already present in the Food Record, this will override that Food Item with the nutritional details specified by user
****

Format: `update n/NAME cal/CALORIES [p/PROTEINS] [c/CARBS] [f/FATS]`

Examples:

* `update n/pizza cal/200 p/10 c/200` +
This command adds a new food item, pizza into the user’s food presets with nutritional details of 200Cal calorie, 10g of protein, 200g of carbohydrates.
* `update n/pizza cal/100 p/10 c/100 f/30` +
As pizza is already in the user’s food preset, this command overrides the nutritional details of pizza with 200Cal calorie, 10g of protein, 200g of carbohydrates and 20g of fats.


[TIP]
You can leave any of the protein, carbohydrates or fats value of a food item blank when updating a Food Item into the Food Record.

=== Listing All Food Items in Calgo's Current Food Record : `list`

To view a list of all Food items in the current Food Record, you can simply use the `list` command. +

* Food items will be listed in alphabetical order with their corresponding details. +

[TIP]
This resets the display to show all Food items, and is most useful after performing a `find` command. +

Format: `list`

=== Showing all food items consumed on a particular day : `stomach`

Displays a list of food items along side how many portions have been consumed on that day.
For a more detailed statistical report with nutritional values of food consumed, see `report` command.

Format: `stomach [d/DATE]`

****
* If a date is not provided, Calgo will take it that the user wishes to see food consumed today.
* `d/` prefix will still have to be present, but the user can choose not to provide any values.
* Date follows yyyy-mm-dd format.
****

Examples:

* `stomach d/2020-03-04`
Displays a list of food user has consumed on 2020-03-04.

* `stomach d/` +
Displays a list of food user has consumed today.

=== Consuming food on a certain day : `nom`

Adds a food item into the log which keeps track of what the user has eaten on that day.

Format: `nom [n/NAME] [d/DATE] [portion/PORTION]`

****
* If a date is not provided, Calgo will take it that the user ate the food today.
* `d/` prefix will still have to be present, but the user can choose not to provide any values.
* Date follows yyyy-mm-dd format.
* User can check how much nutritional content each type of food content by checking the existing list of food.
* Ad-hoc consumption of food coming to you in v1.3 for flexibility should user be lazy to create a food items +
which differs from existing ones/rarely eats. Also marked as ad-hoc since it does not exists in food record in case user
have other plans in the future.
* In v1.3, food items tagged with mood values will be displayed separately.
****

Examples:

* `nom n/chicken d/2020-03-04 portion/1.5` +
Adds 1.5 portion of chicken to the log tracking user's consumption on 4th March 2020.
* `nom n/apple pie d/ portion/2` +
Adds 2 portion of apple pie to the log tracking user's consumption today.

=== Deleting something consumed on a certain day : `vomit`

Deletes a food item that a user has previously added to the log tracking consumption on that day.

Format: `vomit [num/INDEX_OF_FOOD] [d/DATE] [portion/PORTION]`

****
* Deletes a portion of food at the specified `INDEX_OF_FOOD`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed consumption list.
* The index *must be a positive integer*: 1, 2, 3, ...
* If no portion is specified, the whole entry is deleted.
* If user specified a portion greater than what he has consumed, the entire entry will be deleted.
* If no date is specified, Calgo takes it as the date is today.
* Date follows yyyy-mm-dd format.
****

Examples:

* `stomach` +
`vomit num/2 d/ portion/` +
Deletes the second food consumed today in the consumption log displayed using `stomach` command.

* `vomit num/1 d/2020-03-04 portion/3` +
Deletes 3 portions of of the first food item consumed on 2020-03-04.

=== Exporting the Current Food Record into a Reference Sheet : `export`

Should you feel the need to obtain a portable version of the current Food Record entries, the `export` command provides an editable text file (FoodRecords.txt) in the same folder as Calgo. +

* FoodRecords.txt shows the Food Record in alphabetical order of names, and includes the corresponding details of each Food item.

[TIP]
Calgo data is saved in the application automatically. There is no need to save manually for each session. The `export` command allows users to manually track their calories with a reference sheet of the Food entries previously entered.

Format: `export`

=== Getting Food items by Keywords in Name or Nutritional Value : `find`

We can use the `find` command to show all the Food items containing the given keyword in their names, or Food items with a nutritional value lower (or equal to) than the specified value (i.e. either in terms of the number of calories, or grams of proteins/carbohydrates/fat).

* If no such Food item(s) exist, there will be an indicative message shown.

Format: `find [n/NAME] [cal/CALORIES] [p/PROTEINS] [c/CARBS] [f/FATS]` +
Quick-Find Format: `find NAME` (no 'n/' prefix needed)

****
* The search is case insensitive.
** e.g `find n/Kiwi` results can contain both 'kiwi' and 'Kiwi'.
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g.
** e.g. `find Grilled Cheeseburger` and `find Cheeseburger Grilled` have the same results.
* Incompletely-spelled keywords will be matched to all Food items containing it.
** e.g. `find Kiw` can give 'Kiwi' and 'Kiwi Juice'
* Food items containing at least one keyword (even if it is spelt incompletely) will be returned.
** e.g. `find Ki Jui` results can contain 'Kiwi Ice Cream' (which contains 'Ki'), 'Orange Juice' (which contains 'Jui'), and so on.
* In finding Food items via nutritional value, only Food items with nutritional values lower than the one stated will be shown.
** e.g. `find cal/50` results will only contain Food items with calories less than or equal to 50 calories.
****

Examples:

* `find kiwi` +
Returns `kiwi` and `kiwi juice`
* `find p/25` +
Returns `chocolate protein powder shake` and `vanilla protein milkshake` which have 25 and 20 grams of protein respectively.
* `find food_item_not_in_food_record` +
Returns a message showing 0 Food items listed.

=== Setting a dietary goal: `goal`

Sets a numerical goal for the desired number of calorie to be consumed in a day. +

This goal will be used to provide helpful insights for users in the Report. +

Format: `goal GOAL`

Example:

* `goal 2800` +
Sets the desired number of calorie to be consumed to be 2800.


=== Generating insights : `report`
Given a date, the command generates a document (in pdf format) of relevant insights about the user's food consumption pattern of the same date.

****
* The report includes the following insights:
** All Food items consumed on the given date. For each Food item, the following information will be included:
*** Quantity consumed, for instance 3 servings.
*** Number of calorie consumed from the Food item.
*** Amount of carbohydrates, protein and fats consumed from the Food item.

** The user's most liked Food item.
** The total number of calorie consumed in that day.
** The total number of carbohydrates, protein and fats consumed in that day.
** A curated Food plan that includes Food items, that includes a healthy quantity of the user's favourite Food, while ensuring it meets user's dietary goal.
****

Example:

* report `27-03-2020` +
This generates a pdf containing the above-mentioned insights made on the consumption of  Food by the user, on 27th of March 2020.
