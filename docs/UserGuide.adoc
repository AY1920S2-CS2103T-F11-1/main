== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user
** e.g. in `n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `n/kiwi` to name the Food item as 'kiwi'.
* Items in square brackets (i.e. []) are optional
** e.g. in `[t/TAG]`, `TAG` is an optional parameter which can be used as `t/fruit` to tag the Food item as a 'fruit'.
* Parameters can be in any order, as long as the correct prefix appears before the parameter
** e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PROTEINS`, `p/PROTEINS n/NAME` gives the same functionality.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times (including zero times)
** e.g. `[t/TAG]...` implies it can be left empty, or used as `t/favourite`, `t/favourite t/green` or with more than 2 tags.

=== Listing All Food Items in Calgo's Current `Food Record` : `list`

To view a list of all Food items in the current `Food Record`, you can simply use the `list` command. +

* Food items will be listed in alphabetical order with their corresponding details. +

[TIP]
This resets the display to show all Food items, and is most useful after performing a `find` command. +

Format: `list`

=== Showing all food items consumed on a particular day : `stomach`

Displays a list of food items along side how many portions have been consumed on that day.
For a more detailed statistical report with nutritional values of food consumed, see `report` command.

Format: `stomach [d/DATE]`

****
* If a date is not provided, Calgo will take it that the user wishes to see food consumed today.
* If you want to show today's records, inclusion of `d/` prefix is optional.
* Date follows yyyy-mm-dd format.
****

Examples:

* `stomach d/2020-03-04` +

* Date follows yyyy-mm-dd format.
* When opting for default values, inclusion of `d/` and `portion/` prefixes are optional. +
Not giving any values set date to today, and portion to 1 by default.

Format: `vomit [num/INDEX_OF_FOOD] [d/DATE] [portion/PORTION]`

****
* Deletes a portion of food at the specified `INDEX_OF_FOOD`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed consumption list.
* The index *must be a positive integer*: 1, 2, 3, ...
* When opting for default values, inclusion of `d/` and `portion/` prefixes are optional. +
Not giving any values set date to today.
* If no portion is specified, the whole entry is deleted.
* If user specified a portion greater than what he has consumed, the entire entry will be deleted.

<<<

=== Exporting the Current `Food Record` into a Reference Sheet : `export`

Obtaining a copy of the `Food Record` entries may be useful for situations like sharing or printing.
Should you feel the need to obtain a portable version of the current `Food Record` entries, the `export` command provides an editable text file (FoodRecords.txt) in the `data/exports` folder. +

* FoodRecords.txt shows the `Food Record` in alphabetical order of names, and includes the corresponding details of each Food item neatly in a table.

[TIP]
The `export` command allows users to manually track their calories with a reference sheet of the Food entries previously entered. You can freely edit this reference sheet to include information outside of the App. +
[NOTE]
Calgo's session data is saved in the application automatically. There is no need to save manually for each session.

Format: `export`

<<<

=== Getting `Food` items by Nutritional Value or Keywords in Name: `find`

With many `Food` items, it may be difficult to search for a particular `Food` you want. This is where the `find` command comes in nicely.

The `find` command shows all the `Food` items with a nutritional value matching what you specify (either in terms of the number of `Calories`, or grams of `Proteins`/`Carbohydrates`/`Fat`).

Alternatively, you can choose to search for a keyword which may appear in, or as the actual `Name` of a `Food` or a particular `Tag` associated with it.

Format: `find [n/NAME] [cal/CALORIES] [p/PROTEINS] [c/CARBS] [f/FATS] [t/TAG]` (choose only 1 parameter)

****
* In finding Food items via nutritional value, only Food items with exactly matching values will be shown.
** e.g. `find cal/50` results will only contain Food items with calories equal to 50 `Calories`.
* Finding via `Name` or `Tag` is case insensitive.
** e.g `find n/Kiwi` results can contain both 'kiwi' and 'Kiwi'.
****

[TIP]
You don't actually have to type out the entire keyword! Incomplete keywords will be matched to `Food` items containing them in the specified parameter. +
e.g. `find t/Gre` can give 'Kiwi' and 'Sugarcane' which are tagged `Green`
[TIP]
You can search for multiple `Name` keywords by separating them with space(s). +
e.g. `find n/Ki Jui` results can give 'Kiwi Ice Cream' (which contains 'Ki'), 'Orange Juice' (which contains 'Jui'), and so on.

Examples:

* `find n/kIWi` +
Returns `kiwi` and `kiwi juice`
* `find p/25` +
Returns `chocolate protein powder shake` and `vanilla protein milkshake` which both have 25 grams of protein.
* `find n/food_item_not_in_food_record` +
Returns a message showing 0 Food items listed.

<<<

=== Generating an ideal daily calorie goal: `getGoal`

Generates a smart goal based on user's age, gender, height, weight, ideal weight, the date by which they want to reach
their ideal weight and the number of hours they exercise per week.

This helps users provide a scientifically accurate goal based on their target weight and date.

Format: `getGoal a/AGE g/GENDER h/HEIGHT w/WEIGHT i/IDEAL_WEIGHT d/TARGET_DATE e/WEEKLY_EXERCISE_TIME`

Do note the following:
****
* AGE is in number of years.
* GENDER only accepts values "F", "M" and "N" which refer to Female, Male and Non-binary respectively.
* HEIGHT is expressed in centimeters.
* WEIGHT and IDEAL_WEIGHT are expressed in kilograms.
* TARGET_DATE is expressed in yyyy-mm-dd format.
* WEEKLY_EXERCISE_TIME is expressed in hours.
****

Examples:

Returns: "You should consume about 2,580 calories a day to reach your goal of 65 kg. by December 31, 2020."
Sets a goal for the desired number of calories to be consumed in a day. +

=== Setting a daily calorie goal: `setGoal`

This goal will be used to provide helpful insights for users. +

Format: `setGoal GOAL`

Example:

* `setGoal 2580` +
Sets the desired number of calories to be consumed to be 2580.

<<<

=== Generating insights : `report`
Given a date, the command generates a document (in pdf format) of relevant insights about the user's food consumption
pattern of the same date.

****
* The report includes the following insights:
** All Food items consumed on the given date. For each Food item, the following information will be included:
*** Quantity consumed, for instance 3 servings.
*** Number of calories consumed from each Food item.
*** Amount of carbohydrates, protein and fats consumed from each Food item.

** The user's most eaten Food item in the past seven days.
** The total number of calories consumed in that day.
** The total number of carbohydrates, protein and fats consumed in that day.
** A curated Food plan that includes a healthy quantity of the user's favourite Food items,
while ensuring it meets user's daily calorie goal.

Example:

* report `27-03-2020` +
This generates a pdf containing the above-mentioned insights made on the consumption of  Food by the user, on 27th of March 2020.
